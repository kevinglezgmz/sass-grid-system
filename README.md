## Simple Grid System for HTML using SASS.

In this repo you can find both the SASS and CSS code to implement a grid system using HTML.

The grid allows up to 12 columns with the following column spans:

- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 6
- 8
- 12

You can also change the distribution on different resolutions to make the grid responsive, supported device sizes are:

- Mobile (default, up to 768px)
- Tablet (from Mobile up to 992px)
- Laptop (from Tablet up to 1200px)
- Desktop (from Laptop up to inf)

This code was made for the Development of Desktop Applications class by me, Kevin Gonz√°lez.
